IP Address:
Unique address/number given to every machine. So that machine can be easily identified on that network.

1.127.99.45   ---> 32 bit IP Address IPv4

Above is 4-octet Ip Address

0-255

ex: 72.19.121.200 ---> 4 Billions

IPv4 IP Address:
----------------
->One which Facilitate Routing of packets over network using TCP/IP (32-bit) logical address that is known as IPv4. 
Its not Secure 
No encryption of data
NO Authentication



 IPv6  IP Address
-------------------

It is 128 bit hexadecimal address. 
-> It is secure
-> It encrypt data
-> Provides Authentication also.

Total Population today in this world is 7 Billion +
  IPv6  ---> 128bits IP Address can provide more than 7 Billion IP Addresses.

IPv6 IP Address is based on Hexadecimal Number
0- 15
0-9  ,A-F

Ex:

AB12.BA98.5432.3210.FA10.72AB.FFFF.AAAA   (16 Octet)


NAT: Network Address  Translation
-----------------------------------
This translation allows the communication between hosts/machines having different version of IP Address.

Machine1 (IPv6)  <----------- NAT --------->Machine2(IPv4)

NAT is a way to map multiple private IP-Addresses to the public IP-Address in a local network before transferring information.



PORT Number:
-----------
Port Number is an unique number assign to every individual software/application.

Ex: 8080, 5231, 4200 
 0000 to 9999

Note: NO 2 applications can have same port number. Every application should have unique port number.
